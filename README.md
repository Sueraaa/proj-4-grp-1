1. Obesity issue becomes a global issues. It does harm to health issues and cause the fatality. 
2. We try to explore the corelation between multiple factors (varables) to the target (obesity).
3. We aim to build up a model through machine training to predict the possibility of obesity. 
4. With evaluating the model, we hope to get a better model to accurately predict the obesity level by input variables. 



### Locate the data, clean the data, and build the dataframe


* Collect Data from various sources;
* Dataset features a combination of real-world and artificially 
generated data.
* Data analysed and matched against expected categorical 
values. Any features with entries which were outside the 
expected categorical or integer measure need to be explored.
* Binary data is converted to numerical form, making it suitable 
for machine learning models.
* Categorical data is replaced with the appropriate categorical 
measure for consistency in analysis.
* Discrete categorical data (i.e 1, 2 or 3) is replaced with the 
appropriate categorical measurement to represent data 
accurately.

### Data Normalization:
* Ensures all data is in a suitable format for model training.
Conclusion.
* Data Preparation: The code prepares the obesity dataset for analysis
by converting categorical data to numerical data, creating new 
features, and normalizing the data.

### Feature Engineering:
* A new BMI feature is created, representing the ratio of weight 
to height squared.
* A new BMI feature is created, and other features are bucketed into categories.
* Features are bucketed into categories to simplify analysis and 
improve model performance.
* Readiness for Modeling: The processed data is now suitable for training machine learning models to predict obesity levels based on various factors.

### Explore the correlation, building a regression analysis and plot


### Train the machine to build a model 
* Train machine learning models using the processed data.
* Evaluate model performance and interpret results.
* Explore feature importance to understand which factors 
contribute most to obesity levels.
* By following these steps, you can build predictive models and gain 
insights into the factors affecting obesity

### Evaluate the model and choose the best one

### Input variables and predict
